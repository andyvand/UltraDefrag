        <h2 class="content"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2>
        <p>UltraDefrag is a powerful disk defragmentation tool for Windows. It is the first open source defragmenter with
        full support of system locked files defragmentation. Actually all files including registry hives and paging file
        can be processed by UltraDefrag during the Windows boot process.</p>
        <p>Also one of the primary goals of the UltraDefrag design is doing the job as fast and reliable as possible.</p>
        <p>UltraDefrag aims to be the most reliable and small disk defragmenter. We're trying to keep a reasonable balance
        between algorithms complexity and effectiveness.</p>
        <p>UltraDefrag is fully compatible with Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,
        Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and all of the 64-bit editions of Windows.</p>
        <h2>&nbsp;</h2> 
        <p>Some UltraDefrag highlights (the complete list of features is <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/handbook/Introduction.html"><b>here</b></a>):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="../images/boot_time.jpg" alt="Boot Time Defrag" width="250" height="95" /><strong>Boot Time Defragmentation :</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This feature provides an ability to defragment any system files. Including page file, registry hives, hiberfil.sys file and many other files locked by the system or other applications when windows is fully running.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="../images/shutdown_job.jpg" alt="Shutdown after a job" width="250" height="95" /><strong>Computer Shut Down after a job has completed :</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We all know how long a defragment or a compact job can take. All of us most of the time leave the PC unattended while it does its job. With this option you can set UD to shutdown the PC after a job has been completed. This saves electricity and avoids many hazards.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="../images/compact_feature.jpg" alt="Compact Option" width="250" height="95" /><strong>Fast Disk Optimization:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The optimizer rearranges all data and places them to the beginning of the drive. In many instances we have found, that the system is more stable and performs a lot better under load, if data is placed at the beginning of the drive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="../images/folder_file.jpg" alt="Single File and Folder Defragmentation" width="250" height="95" /><strong>Single File and Folder Defragmentation :</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After UltraDefrag is installed you have the ability to select any file or folder and defragment it. This option is mostly useful, if you have recently installed an application or a game and would like to have it defragmented immediately for maximum performance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="../images/extended_gui.jpg" alt="Single File and Folder Defragmentation" width="250" height="95" /><strong>Extended and Customizable G.U.I :</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>UltraDefrag allows you to customize its graphical user interface, such as Font and its sizes. It adapts to the Windows theme you are using. Unlike Vista and other versions of Windows Defrag, UD shows a graphical representation of the drive like it did on older generations of Windows.</p>
