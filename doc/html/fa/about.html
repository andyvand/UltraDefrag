        <p>UltraDefrag was originally written by <strong>Dmitri Arkhangelski</strong>. He is the chief architect, 
        the main programmer and the project administrator.</p>
        <p><strong>Justin Dearing</strong> proposed the idea for the boot time defragmentation and wrote the original manual.
        Also he wrote the UltraDefrag Scheduler.</p>
        <p><strong>Sayem Chaklader</strong> is the webmaster for the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Stefan Pendl</strong> is the translation manager for the project. 
        As a true magician, he invented also a lot of features, rewrote the documentation,
        the installer and scripts used to build the program. Stefan performs intensive 
        testing of all the new code. He wrote a set of special scripts to automate 
        some stages of testing.</p>
        <p>Many people have been worked on UltraDefrag translations. Full list of translators is

            <h3>Biography:</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of Dmitri's education he wrote a simple  program to generate random numbers. This work will not be published.</p>
            <p>Later Dmitri attempted to write a GUI shell for MS DOS similar to Windows  3.11. His goal was to write it entirely in assembly. He called it  FSHELL! After six months of hard work he wrote about 50 % of the code  to get this working; including some  base libraries and startup code. The code is not portable to other CPUs  (eg: PPC), and he believes FShell is not particularly useful. However,  Dmitri has not ruled out the posibility of publishing the code.</p>
            <p>Dmitri then decided to leave windows and learn more about open  source operating systems. He briefly experimented with the Amiga Research  Operating System (AROS). His conclusion was it was nice but not useful.</p>
            <p>Then Dmitri encountered a practical problem that was of great  interest to him . . . Disk Defragmentation. Thus UltraDefrag was born.</p>
            <p>A few years of intensive work on UltraDefrag brought Dmitri not only a chance to master his programming skills, but also a chance to understand
            secrets of the software development art covered by Eric S. Raymond in his immortal <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/">The Art of Unix Programming</a> book.</p>

            <p>Justin did some programming in Basic on the Apple II starting at age 9. He  later attempted to teach himself C++, but found C to his liking.</p>
            <p>At age 18 Justin discovered Linux and FreeBSD. He experiemnted  with Shell scripting, perl, java and of course C. He released his first  Open Source project, Sanctum, a JAVA wrapper around bochs that he wrote  with help from a friend. The program achieved partial functionality, but was never  completed. The source is available on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sanctum">sourceforge</a>.</p>
            <p>Justin later began working for a series of companies in IT and  programming capacities. He currently is a .NET programmer for a small company with  the title of Senior Developer.</p>
            <p>In addition to maintaining the documentation for UltraDefrag,  Justin is the author of <a href="http://plane-disaster.sf.net">PlaneDisaster.NET</a> a SQL front end to JetSQL (MSACCESS) and SQLite databases. He has also  contributed to the following projects: <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/">SharpDevelop</a>, <a href="http://astrogrep.sourceforge.net/">Astrogrep, SharpBarcode</a> and <a href="http://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.net/">XML Copy Editor</a>.                      </p>

            <h3>Biography:</h3>
            <p>Stefan started his computer career around the age of 10, getting in touch with the Commodore 64 of his cousin.
            At the age of 14 he decided to replace his accordion by a Commodore 64 of his own.
            He now started to type programs from PC magazines into his C64 and created some simple BASIC programs of his own.</p>
            <p>After finishing grammar school, he started to become a toolmaker, instead of studying computers at the University, since there was no room left for him.
            Some time after he successfully finished the toolmaker exam, he became NC-programmer, which nicely fit into his initial education plans.
            In his new work area he was maintaining the CAD/CAM environment too, which replaced the work as NC-programmer finally.</p>
            <p>Now he is system manager of the CAD/CAM department and develops small utilities to make the everyday work of the designers and programmers easier.
            He is responsible for automating CAD/CAM processes, data security and keeping the system going.</p>
