/**
 * @page Introduction Introduction
 *
 * <h1>Preface</h1>
 * UltraDefrag speeds up the computer by defragmentation of files.
 *
 * When files consist of many little fragments scattered around the disk
 * the computer needs more mechanical work to read them. Because of that
 * the disk access becomes slower.
 *
 * UltraDefrag reduces the file fragmentation, thus it makes disk
 * operations faster. Also the program can optimize a whole disk
 * by placing small files close to each other sorted by path.
 * After the disk optimization less mechanical work is needed
 * to read groups of small files. This reduces startup times
 * of many applications including web and photo browsers.
 *
 * In contrast with the most other disk defragmenters UltraDefrag
 * can defragment locked files by running during the Windows boot.
 * Actually all files including page and hibernation files
 * can be defragmented there.
 *
 * Also UltraDefrag aims to be fast, simple, reliable and efficient.
 *
 * <h1>About the software</h1>
 * UltraDefrag has the following features:
 * - system files defragmentation (page-file, hibernation file, ...)
 * - MFT (master file table) defragmentation
 * - NTFS metafiles defragmentation
 * - ultra fast NTFS analysis
 * - fast defragmentation algorithm
 * - effective disk optimization algorithm
 * - safety, it can never damage processed files
 * - simplicity, it can be used without reading the documentation
 * - ability to defragment single files/directories from the context menu of Explorer
 * - ability to defragment additional streams attached to NTFS files
 * - ability to exclude any unimportant files based on flexible filters
 * - ability to defragment files, which have more fragments than specified by a threshold
 * - ability to automatically break defragmentation when the specified time interval elapses
 * - ability to select multiple disks for defragmentation
 * - well readable HTML reports
 * - powerful command line interface
 * - ability to automatically hibernate/shutdown PC after a job is done
 * - ability to make an automatic effective defragmentation through Windows Task Scheduler
 * - multilingual graphical interface
 * - little binaries (about 500 kb)
 * - portable version available which requires no installation
 * - native 64-bit support
 * - open source code licensed under GPL
 *
 * UltraDefrag runs on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista,
 * Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7, including all 64 bit versions of Windows.
 *
 * Both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 have very restricted Defrag API,
 * so the most recent versions of UltraDefrag doesn't support them.
 * However, the 5.0.x series of UltraDefrag is fully compatible
 * with Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.
 *
 * UltraDefrag cannot be used on DOS, Windows 9x, Windows NT 3.51 and Mac OS
 * since these operating systems provide no defragmentation API.
 * However, <a href="http://b.andre.pagesperso-orange.fr/advanced-ntfs-3g.html">Linux port of UltraDefrag</a> exists.
 * It is based on NTFS-3G capabilities.
 *
 * <h1>Supported file-systems</h1>
 * The following file-systems can be defragmented by UltraDefrag:
 * FAT12/16/32, exFAT and NTFS.
 *
 * There are a few system restrictions which apply to disk
 * defragmentation. Unfortunately UltraDefrag cannot take away
 * these restrictions:
 * - The first clusters of FAT directories cannot be moved.
 *   This is a well known FAT driver restriction and cannot be fixed.
 *   So, UltraDefrag cannot defragment FAT directories. It tries to
 *   optimize them instead by placing all fragments close to each other
 *   behind the first one.
 * - The first 16 clusters of MFT cannot be moved, this is a file
 *   system driver limitation. So, UltraDefrag cannot defragment
 *   the MFT. However, it can optimize it by placing all fragments
 *   close to each other.
 *
 * <h1>Processing algorithms</h1>
 *
 * <h2>Defragmentation algorithm</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The analysis phase scans the whole disk to collect
 * information about all files and free space.</li>
 * <li>The defragmentation phase eliminates little fragments
 * by joining them together. This speeds up access to individual files.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Optimization algorithm</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The analysis phase is the same as for defragmentation.</li>
 * <li>The next phase moves all small files and fragments to the end of the
 * disk to free space at the beginning of it.</li>
 * <li>The third phase moves small files back, sorted by path
 * in ascending order. This speeds up access to groups of files.</li>
 * <li>The last phase defragments all files.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @note Optimization algorithm ignores any size, name and fragment count filters.
 *
 * Sometimes even the disk optimization fails to make a large 
 * continuous free space gap. This happens when unmovable (locked)
 * files are scattered around the disk. In order to defragment big
 * files (pagefile etc.) in such cases they are two workarounds available:
 * - Move all files to another disk, reformat the disk and move
 * all back. This causes the perfect disk optimization.
 * - Run <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">GParted</a> or
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PartitionMagic">Partition
 * Magic</a> to manually reduce the disk size as much as possible.
 * This operation will move all files including system files to the
 * beginning of the disk. After restoring the original size, you
 * will have a large continuous free space area at the end
 * of the disk. This space may be used hereafter to
 * defragment large files.
 *
 * @note
 * UltraDefrag always skips files located directly in MFT
 * records (these files usually have sizes below 1kb), because they are
 * actually part of the MFT. Also files which have no content are skipped,
 * because actually there are no clusters on disk belonging to them.
 * Additionally, UltraDefrag never tries to defragment files marked as
 * temporary by applications which created them. Because such files
 * will be deleted soon, therefore they will not decrease the system performance.
